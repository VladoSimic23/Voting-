## Vite
Vite is a modern, opinionated build tool that is designed to be fast and lightweight. It is a next-generation build tool that replaces the traditional bundler used in most modern web development workflows. Vite provides an instant development server with hot module reloading, which allows developers to make changes to their code and see the results instantly in the browser. It also has built-in support for popular front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte, and supports modern web development features such as ES Modules and dynamic imports. Vite is a popular choice for developers who want a fast, modern, and opinionated build tool for their front-end development workflow.

## Typescript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to improve the development experience, catch errors earlier, and make code more scalable and maintainable. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, allowing developers to use it in any environment that supports JavaScript.
